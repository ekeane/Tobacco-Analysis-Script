# Tobacco-Analysis-Script
Developed a Python script to analyze smoking data of various countries around the world and visualized my findings.
My project aimed to determine if the numbers of people smoking everyday decreased as former smokers increased over time in 
Puerto Rico. I discovered that smoking everyday and formers smokers were negatively correlated.
